# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are a group of design patterns in software engineering that focus on how objects are created and instantiated within a software system. They provide solutions to common problems related to object creation, ensuring that objects are created in a flexible, efficient, and controlled manner. These patterns help manage the process of object creation, hiding the details of instantiation and making the system more adaptable to changes.

In simpler terms, creational design patterns help answer questions like:

### How can you create objects without knowing their specific classes in advance?

### How can you ensure that only one instance of a class is created?

### How can you control the way objects are created and configured?

### How can you create objects efficiently, especially when creating them is resource-intensive?

Creational design patterns include patterns like `Singleton`, `Factory Method`, `Abstract Factory`,` Builder`, and `Prototype`.
