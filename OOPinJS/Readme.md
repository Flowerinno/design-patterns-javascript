# Object Oriented Programming in javascript

### Encapsulation:

Definition: Encapsulate methods and properties in an object

### Abstraction:

Definition: In simple terms abstraction hides complexity, hiding internal details. 

### Inheritance:

Definition: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (or object) can inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (or object).
In JavaScript: JavaScript supports prototype-based inheritance. You can create objects that inherit properties and methods from other objects by setting their prototypes. ES6 introduced the class syntax, making it more similar to traditional class-based inheritance.

### Polymorphism:

Definition: Overwrite parent methods with subclass methods.
In JavaScript: JavaScript supports polymorphism through method overriding. You can define methods in subclasses (objects) that have the same name as methods in their parent classes. When you call the method on an instance of a subclass, it uses the subclass's implementation.
