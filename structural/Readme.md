# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are a group of design patterns in software engineering that focus on how objects and classes are structured and composed to form larger, more complex structures. These patterns help define how objects interact and compose to create flexible and reusable software architectures. They are concerned with the relationships between objects and classes, rather than their individual creation or behavior.

In simpler terms, structural design patterns help answer questions like:

### How can you build complex structures by combining simple objects and classes?

### How can you create relationships between objects to achieve specific functionalities?

### How can you ensure that changes to one part of the system don't impact the rest of the system?

### How can you represent hierarchical structures or complex relationships between objects?

Structural design patterns include patterns like `Adapter`, `Bridge`, `Composite`, `Decorator`, `Facade`, `Flyweight`, and `Proxy`.
